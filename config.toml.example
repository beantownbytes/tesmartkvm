# Usage:
#   teskvm get port                    # Uses default_connection ("home")
#   teskvm -c work get port            # Uses "work" connection
#   teskvm --connection home set port 2 # Uses "home" connection explicitly
#   teskvm list                        # Lists port names for default connection
#   teskvm -c work list                # Lists port names for "work" connection
